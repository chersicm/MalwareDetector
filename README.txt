INSTRUCTIONS
1) Download the project or checkout the repository at https://github.com/michelechersich/MalwareDetector.git, using Git or SVN
2) Download Android Studio: https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html
3) Open the SDK manager in Android Studio and download the SDK tools
4) Open the terminal and cd to the location where the SDK tools are installed
5) Connect an Android device, either via USB with debugging enabled or via emulator (using the AVD manager, set up a virtual device, e.g. Nexus 5, Android 5.0, x86 and launch it in the emulator)
6) The main project folder contains the built application ("MalwareDetector.apk"), ready to be installed
7) In the terminal, execute:
	adb devices
8) The list should now contain one device. Install the application:
	adb install <path-to-MalwareDetector.apk>
9) Before launching the application, grant the application a required permission:
	adb shell pm grant alarilab.malwaredetector android.permission.DUMP
This permission will last until the application is uninstalled or a factory reset is performed on the device (in case of emulator, until the data are wiped).
10) Finally, the application can be launched on the device

From the main project folder, the code can be found at:
	app/src/main/java/alarilab/malwaredetector/

The threads that run in the application can be found in folder "services"; folder "core" contains the implementation of device monitoring; folder "detection" contains the implementation of the detection algorithms; folder "ui" contains the implementation of the Graphical User Interface.
For more details, please refer to the project report.
